# weight_converter

A basic weight conversion Tkinter GUI for stones, Kilos and Pounds.

This is another little desktop program I wrote for myself, mainly for practice. 
I enjoyed learning how to do a try except properly (I think) to trap any non-numeric inputs.

Works on Windows, should work on Linux and Mac.
